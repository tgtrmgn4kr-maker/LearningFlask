# LearningFlask

This repository is for recording my learning progress

## Blocks

### web.py

This file is the main program of the website

### static

This directory is for storing static files like css, javascript, imagine, and icon

### templates

This directory is for storing web pages which is html files

### access.log and error.log

These two files are for recording the log of the website

## What I practiced

- Using `Flask(__name__)` to make a website
- Using `url_for()` to generate url for another function
- Using `render_template()` to direct to a web page and import arguments
- Using `RotatingFileHandler()` to record the log when the website runs
- Using `ngrok http 80` in command line to release the website which could only be seen on the host
- Using `{{ }}` and `{% %}` to execute the Python code in a html file
